<h2>ResNow</h2>

ResNow is an application for reservation taking and making. It's a perfect way
for small buisnesses to take reservations. Use-cases include: hair salons, restaurants... etc.
Basically anywhere that reservations are required. Create a calendar then tell your 
friends/clients to search for it in the "Discover calendars" section of their home page.
Once they've found it they can create reservations.
